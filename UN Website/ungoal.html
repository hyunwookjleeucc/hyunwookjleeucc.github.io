  <p id="big" class=center><b>Why does this website exist?</b></p>

</div>

<div class="bodytext">
  <p>I will discuss and educate about the two UN Sustainability Goals: <i><b>Climate Action</i></b> and <i><b>Quality Education</i></b>. Specifically, for Climate Action, I will explain and outline ways we can mitigate the effects of climate change- mainly through Geothermal Energy. Next, for Quality Education, I will describe the positive impacts Quality Education can have on societies, with elements of equality (gender, economic, etc) and low cost. Finally, there will be a third page, explaining and evaluating in detail, the link between the two Sustainability Goals and how they can impact the world.</p>

  <p>This website will mainly target high school students (Grade 9-12) with a basic knowledge in both of these fields, but not a high level of expertise. This means that the related vocabulary will be defined and there will be links to find more information as a follow-up to the main webpage. This website is significant and should be pursued for several reasons. First, climate change is at its all-time high, with rapid changes occurring; the rate of climate change has been continuously increasing. Educating students, the future generation, about climate change and ways to mitigate the effects will be incredibly beneficial, because this will intrigue them and will cause them to look into the world that they live in, and will also create change in their lives and potentially the future. Next, the heat for education has never been higher. The competitiveness is ever increasing and this is the perfect time to evaluate the education system and renew them, because without quality education, there is no future. Moreover, if the climate condition worsens, it is not possible to have quality education; students cannot learn if there is no electricity in their classrooms or the climate is unbearably hot. Last, the link between Climate Action and Quality Education is in fact incredibly strong; one cannot exist without the other. To conclude, this project should be pursued as this will educate the students who are the future of the world on these two pressing issues and it can improved the quality of life.</p>
