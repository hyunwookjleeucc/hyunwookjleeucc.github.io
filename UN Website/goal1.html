  		<p>
  			The heat for higher level education has never been higher. The competitiveness is ever increasing and now is the perfect time to evaluate the education system and renew them, because without quality education, there is no future.
		</p>

    <p>
      Education lays a foundation for vibrant lives for girls and women, their families, and their communities. It also is one of the most powerful levers available for avoiding emissions by curbing population growth. Women with more years of education have fewer and healthier children, and actively manage their reproductive health.

    </p>
    <p>
      Educated women realize higher wages and greater upward mobility, contributing to economic growth. Their rates of maternal mortality drop, as do mortality rates of their babies. They are less likely to marry as children or against their will. They have lower incidence of HIV/AIDS and malaria. Their agricultural plots are more productive and their families better nourished.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are economic, cultural, and safety-related barriers that impede 62 million girls around the world from realizing their right to education. Key strategies to change that include:
    </p>

<p>-make school affordable;</p>
<p>-help girls overcome health barriers; and,</p>
<p>-reduce the time and distance to get to school </p>

<p>Gender inequality is not only a pressing moral and social issue but also a critical economic challenge. If women—who account for half the world’s working-age population—do not achieve their full economic potential, the global economy will suffer. While all types of inequality have economic consequences, in McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) report, The power of parity: How advancing women’s equality can add $12 trillion to global growth, we focus on the economic implications of lack of parity between men and women.</p> 

<p>
A “best in region” scenario in which all countries match the rate of improvement of the fastest-improving country in their region could add as much as $12 trillion, or 11 percent, in annual 2025 GDP. In a “full potential” scenario in which women play an identical role in labor markets to that of men, as much as $28 trillion, or 26 percent, could be added to global annual GDP by 2025. MGI’s full-potential estimate is about double the average estimate of other recent studies, reflecting the fact that MGI has taken a more comprehensive view of gender inequality in work.</p>

<p>Even after decades of progress toward making women equal partners with men in the economy and society, the gap between them remains large. Gender parity in economic outcomes (such as participation in the workforce or presence in leadership positions) is not necessarily a normative ideal, as it involves human beings making personal choices about the lives they lead. However, improving pairity can contribute significantly to economic growth.</p>

<p>The way to achieve equality would be to have more women be educated at a higher level in not only developing countries, but also developed countries. Women with higher education means there are more brains put into the problem solving process.</p>
