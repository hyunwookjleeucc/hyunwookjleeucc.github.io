  		<p>The link between Climate Action and Quality Education is in fact incredibly strong; one cannot exist without the other. If the climate condition worsens, it is impossible to have quality education; students cannot learn if there is no electricity in their classrooms or the climate is unbearably hot.
  		</p>

  		<p> Quality education also shores up resilience and equips girls and women to face the impacts of climate change. They can be more effective stewards of food, soil, trees, and water, even as nature’s cycles change. They have greater capacity to cope with shocks from natural disasters and extreme weather events.</p>

  		<p>Population growth is a direct result of fertility, mortality, and migration. Therefore, education, which influences the dynamics of all three, is extremely relevant for projections of population growth. The educational composition of a society can either challenge or facilitate reductions in greenhouse gases, thus possibly reversing global warming.</p>

<p>Among educational factors influencing population growth, female education and education-specific fertility are predominant. In most contexts, the amount of education achieved influences the timing of marriage, timing of births, desired family size, and total number of births. Women with more schooling tend to marry later, delay childbearing longer, and have fewer children than their peers who have less education. The impact of education on females’ fertility is context-specific and varies by a country’s stage of development—with the educational composition of women in countries that have yet to complete the demographic transition having a particularly strong effect on fertility and future population.</p>

<p>In addition to or in concert with family planning, female education is one of the proven, cost-effective long-term solutions for addressing unsustainable rates of population growth in high-fertility countries.</p>

<p><b>Methodology</b></p>

<p>Recognizing that there are differences in emissions per capita (i.e. productive and consumptive behavior is not consistent across populations), generally, fewer emitters means fewer emissions. This analysis models the impact of increased adoption of family planning from 2020-2050 on emissions from energy use, building space, food, waste and transportation by comparing a Plausible Scenario (increased adoption of family planning) to a Reference Scenario (no additional investment in family planning).</p>

<p>The most cited literature for population projections is the UN Population Prospect, released by the United Nations Population Division Department of Economic and Social Affairs every 2 years. The UN population projections rely on use of three key inputs to determine the growth in population - fertility, mortality, international migration (World Population Prospects, 2010). Using these parameter inputs, the UN generates three variants of population projections, High, Medium and Low. This analysis adopts the UN 2015 High Variant as the Reference Scenario. Since the UN Medium Variant represents a declining fertility trend in high and medium fertility countries attributable to an optimistic assumption of effective uptake of family planning, this analysis uses the 2015 Medium Variant as the Plausible Scenario.</p>

<p>For the UN Medium Variant, fertility in high and medium fertility countries is assumed to follow a fertility decline path derived from models of past experiences of all countries with declining fertility during 1950 to the current period. Total fertility in all countries is assumed to converge eventually toward a level of 1.85 children per woman (World Population Prospects, 2015). Under the UN high variant, fertility is projected to remain 0.5 children above the fertility in the Medium Variant (Plausible Scenario).</p>


<p><b>Results</b></p>

<p>The results of the Plausible Scenario show that reducing estimated population size could avoid 119.2 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions from 2020-2050. It is assumed that this impact is a result of a combination of providing family planning resources and educating girls. Due to a lack of sufficient data to accurately distinguish between these mechanisms, Project Drawdown chose to split the total emissions results equally. Therefore, the estimated impact of educating girls is reported as 59.6 gigatons of carbon dioxide-equivalent.</p>

<p><b>Discussion</b></p>

<p>Demographic change, including population growth, age distribution, extent of urbanization, and household size all affect consumption and production of energy, and therefore emissions (O’Neill et al, 2012). Decreasing  population growth offers the potential to be a substantial solution to global warming. A number of simulation models have demonstrated that decreasing the rate of population growth could potentially reduce global CO2 emissions (O’Neill et al, 2010).
Using the UN population projections from 2004, if countries’ total fertility rate followed the low rather than medium variant, worldwide emissions would be reduced by 1.4 gigatons of carbon (GtC) per year in 2050. However, if the population were to follow the high variant, emissions would increase by 1.7 GtC per year in 2050 (O’Neill et al, 2012).</p>

<p>Addressing unsustainable human population growth is critical to climate change mitigation. Rapid population growth threatens the sustainability of the planet since humans will overexploit natural resources and contribute to CO2 levels in the world. When considering population growth as a source of emissions, it is important to consider that population growth is highest in low and middle income countries. However, emissions per capita are greatest in high income countries. As developing countries continue to grow economically, they often begin to mirror the consumption and production patters of developed countries such as the United States. This means that even if developing countries slow their population growth rates, they may begin to increase their contribution to global emissions through an increase in per capita emissions.</p>

<p>Therefore, population intervention strategies cannot solely focus on the total number of future emitters but also their future emissions patterns. This is why education is crucial in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. If women are provided equal quality of and access to education as men not only is it likely they will pursue smaller families, but they will have the knowledge and understanding to adopt attitudes and behaviours that that will help their families and communities mitigate the impacts and adapt to climate change.</p>
