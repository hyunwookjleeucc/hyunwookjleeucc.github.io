  			With unprecedented consequences of climate change throughout the world, finding  sustainable sources of energy to power the world is critical. One of the most promising source is geothermal energy, which minimizes the effects of global warming and climate change such as pollution and emission of greenhouse gases.
		</p>

		<p>
			<i>What is Geothermal Energy?</i>
		</p>

		<p>
			Geothermal Energy refers to the energy from within the Earth itself. The earth’s core is around 6,000°C in temperature, which melt rocks around it to form magma. Heat is released in this layer of magma, mostly from the decay of radioactive materials such as uranium and potassium. Seismic, tectonic, and magma movement break up the rocks, causing water to circulate. As the water rises to the surface, natural hot springs and geysers appear and the temperature can be higher than 200°C. The ground below a local school has enough thermal energy to control the climate in other buildings in the community.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>How is Science used?</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			The science behind geothermal energy is simple. The most common way of capturing the energy from geothermal sources is to use "hydrothermal convection" systems, where cooler water seeps into Earth's crust, is heated up, and then rises to the surface. Once this heated water is forced to the surface, geothermal power plants capture that steam and use it to drive electric generators. Geothermal power plants drill their own holes into the rocks to more effectively capture the steam.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are three basic designs for geothermal power plants, all of which pull hot water and steam from the ground, use it, and then return it as warm water to elongate the life of the heat source. In the simplest design, called dry steam, the steam goes directly through the turbine, then into a condenser where the steam is transformed into water. In a second approach, hot water is depressurized into steam which then can be used to run the turbine. In the third approach, known as a binary cycle system, the hot water is passed through a heat exchanger, where it heats a second liquid such as isobutane in a closed loop. Isobutane boils at a lower temperature than water, so it is more easily converted into steam. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>What are the possible environmental implications of Geothermal Energy?</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			First, the hotspots of Geothermal energy are found on less than 10 percent of the planet. However, EGS can be used to drill holes in the hot rocks and extract more value from Geothermal Energy; yet, these can cause earthquakes and land subsidences (a natural disaster where the land surface sinks). There is evidence that geothermal plants can lead to more frequent seismic activities. 
			Geothermal power plants can also impact both water quality and consumption as the water pumped from the underground often contain high levels of sulfur, salt, and other minerals. While there were no known cases of water contamination from geothermal plants in the United States, given that these geothermal power plants may contribute to seismic activities, the confinement of water can break and the contaminated water may leak and adulterate the environment around it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Next, open-loop geothermal systems emit hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, ammonia, and, methane. Hydrogen Sulfide becomes sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the atmosphere, which can cause heart and lung disease due to the acidic particulates. Moreover, sulfur dioxide also causes acid rain, damaging crops and contaminating lakes or rivers.
			Carrying on, There are several positive implications to the environment as well. First, it creates significantly less CO2 than other methods. Coal and natural gas each produce 1,041 and 622 tonnes equivalent of CO2 per gigawatt-hour of energy they produce. On the other hand, geothermal produces 15 tonnes, because there is no combustion involved.
			Lastly, compared to other ways of generating electricity, eg: coal or natural gas, geothermal energy does not emit a significant amount of greenhouse gases. While it is true that it does emit them, it is minimal and as technology evolves, there will be ways to mitigate these effects using science. The SO2 (Sulfur Dioxide) emissions from geothermal plants are 30 times lower per megawatt-hour than from coal plants, which is the US’s largest SO2 source.
		</p>
		<p>
			Overall, geothermal energy has its strengths and limitations. While increased chances of earthquakes or land subsidence may give geothermal energy a dangerous perception, all these side effects can be mitigated. For land subsidence, refilling the reservoirs reduce the risk of disaster, and for increased seismic activities, a solution is to build the power plant away from large civilian populations. The potential for a cleaner Earth is greater than the possible side effects that can be mitigated. In evaluation, geothermal energy is the key to a sustainable future and a cleaner Earth as it can power the world while not triggering negative environmental problems.

  		<p>Figure 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 are from a study evaluating geothermal energy. It shows the efficiency (%) of the geothermal power plants (on the y-axis) with varying well depths (km), reservoir enthalpy (kj/kg), and well temperatures (°C), as independent variables (on the x-axis) (Martin, Perry & Lushnikov, 2018). This shows how science is used to measure the efficiency and the successes of these power plants.</p>
  		<p>Figure 2 displays the tons of CO2 emitted by different Electricty Generation Systems. We can see that coal and natural gas each produce 1,041 and 622 tonnes equivalent of CO2 per gigawatt-hour of energy they produce. On the other hand, geothermal produces 15 tonnes, because there is no combustion involved.</p>
